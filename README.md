# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C++. Each file corresponds to a different sorting algorithm.

## Files

1. **Insertion.cpp**: This file contains the implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm. It sorts an array of doubles and writes the unsorted and sorted arrays to `InsertionUnsortedArray.txt` and `InsertionSortedArray.txt` respectively.

2. **Merge.cpp**: This file contains the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm. It sorts an array of doubles and writes the unsorted and sorted arrays to `MergeUnsortedArray.txt` and `MergeSortedArray.txt` respectively.

3. **Quick.cpp**: This file contains the implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm. It sorts an array of doubles and writes the unsorted and sorted arrays to `QuickUnsortedArray.txt` and `QuickSortedArray.txt` respectively.

4. **Selection.cpp**: This file contains the implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm. It sorts an array of doubles and writes the unsorted and sorted arrays to `SelectionUnsortedArray.txt` and `SelectionSortedArray.txt` respectively.

## Usage

To use these files, compile and run them with a C++ compiler. When prompted, enter the size of the array to be sorted. The program will generate an array of that size with random double values between 100.00 and 1000.00, sort it using the corresponding sorting algorithm, and write the unsorted and sorted arrays to text files.
